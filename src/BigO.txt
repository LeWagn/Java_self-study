Recap on Big O Notation (Fast to Slow, considering large Data-Sets):

O(1) = constant time
=> Random Access of Element in an Array; Inserting at the beginning of a linkedList.

O(log n) = logarithmic time
=> Binary Search.

O(n) = linear time
=> Looping through elements in an array; searching throuhg a linkedList.

O(n log n) = quasilinear time
=> Quicksort; Mergesort; Heapsort;

O(nÂ²) = quadratic time
=> Insertion Sort; Selection Sort; Bubblesort;

O(n!) = factorial time
=> Traveling Salesman Problem
