Außerdem:
Datatypes:
- Defines a domain of values. 
- Defines Operations allowed on those values.

Bsp.:
int type: only allowes int values (no doubles etc.) and allows * + % / etc. ().
=> float does not allow % operator.

User-Defined Data Types:

ADT:
define operations on values using functions without specifying what's inisde the funtion and how
those operations are performed.
e.g. Stack: 
consists of ELements of the same type arranged in a sequential order.
Operations: push, pop, isEmpty, isFull...
=> just specifying, not implementing. (Black Box that hides the inner structure and design of the Data Type from the User)

Bsp.: Can implement Stack using Arrays or LinkedLists.

Why do we need those "Skeletons"?
Program that uses DS is called "client" program.
The one that implmenets the DS is known as the "implementation".
=> Client can use the DS Methods withouth knowing the implementation.
=> If Implementation is changed from array to linkedList, the client program won't be affected and will function normally.

Review: ADT provides abstraction.
